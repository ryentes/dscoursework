The data in this dataset is a refinement of the data contained in the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set created by Reyes-Ortiz and colleagues
the original data set is available for download at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

As per Reyez-Ortiz description, their dataset contains measurements of each of 30 participants completed each of 6 activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, and standing)

This data set was created by combining Reyes-Ortiz and colleagues' test and train datasets, and retaining only the (66) variables that represented the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Then, the within-person, within-actvity mean of each of the retained variables was computed. Thus, for each of 30 participants, this dataset contains six rows of data. One for each of the six activities they completed, for a total of 180 rows of data (plus a header with variable names). Each row contains the participants identification number, the activity they were completing, and the set of within-person, within-activity means that were computed.

below is a list of the 68 variables included in the dataset with a brief description of each.

**subjectID** - An identification number for the participant completing the experiment

**activityID** - A description of the activity the participant was performing

**tBodyAccMeanX** - Mean bodily acceleration over time in the x dimension (in meters per second))

**tBodyAccMeanY** - Mean bodily acceleration over time in the Y dimension (in meters per second)

**tBodyAccMC**: - Mean bodily acceleration over time in the Z dimension (in meters per second))

**tBodyAccStdX** - Standard deviation of the bodily acceleration over time in the x dimension

**tBodyAccStdY** - Standard deviation of the bodily acceleration over time in the y dimension

**tBodyAccStdZ** - Standard deviation of the bodily acceleration over time in the z dimension

**tGravityAccMeanX** - Gravity component for acceleration in the x dimension (in meters per second)

**tGravityAccMeanY** - Gravity component for acceleration in the y dimension (in meters per second)

**tGravityAccMeanZ** - Gravity component for acceleration in the z dimension (in meters per second)

**tGravityAccStdX** -  standard deviation of the gravity component for acceleration in the x dimension

**tGravityAccStdY** - Standard deviation of the gravity component for acceleration in the y dimension
